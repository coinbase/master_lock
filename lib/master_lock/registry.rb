module MasterLock
  # When MasterLock acquires a lock, it registers it with a global registry.
  # MasterLock will periodically renew all locks that are registered as long as
  # the thread that acquired the lock is still alive and has not explicitly
  # released the lock yet. If there is a failure to renew the lock, MasterLock
  # identifies the lock as having already been released.
